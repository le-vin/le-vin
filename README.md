ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ben Levin Bauschke

I am very passionate about digital business models and the latest technologies. 
Out of these interests started out getting involved with coding. I made my first experiences with programming during my time at the Coding School Le Wagon. 
This is where my first web development projects came from. The biggest project was the development of the web application footzooker. 
Feel free to check it out!
Since the beginning of my master studies I am working with Python and SQL in the context of data processing. 
The biggest project from this time is the prediction of AirBnB prices to find out which characteristics of an apartment are relevant 
to increase the revenue. 
During this project I worked through the whole process of a machine learning pipeline. Data acquisition, data preparation, train-test splitting, 
model creation as well as evaluation and predictions of the prices are part of this project.
